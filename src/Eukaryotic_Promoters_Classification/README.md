# Nucleic_Transformer_Eukaryotic_Promoters

To run: 
1. download datasets from release
2. create a new folder 'data' and put the csv files in said folder
3. in each folder there's a ```run.sh``` to run training for that specific dataset

Folders with '''deepromoter''' suffix are code to run deepromoter training with the same hyperparameters and architecture in the deepromoter paper on the dataset described by the folder name
